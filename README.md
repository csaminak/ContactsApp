# ContactsApp
A very basic web interface for a database that stores contact information data in a relational database, and displays the information back to the user.

### Requirements

*Keeping the User Experience in mind and using TDD:*

- Build the backend in Ruby on Rails (or another backend language of your choosing).
- Build the front end ideally in ReactJS, AngularJS, or Python
- App should be well tested both on the front and backend (you can use whichever testing suite youâ€™d like)
- CreateForm that takes the following information:
  - `firstName`
  - `lastName`
  - `emailAddress`
  - `phoneNumber`
  - `companyName`
- App should display the list of contacts and their data
- When a user adds the above information to the form, after clicking 'Submit' the new information should be added to the displayed list of contacts immediately without refreshing the page
- App should allow the deletion of specific contacts that are removed immediately without a page refresh
- Allow the list of contacts to be filtered to show:
  - Only contacts with `.com` email addresses
  - Order the contacts alphabetically by email address (ascending and descending)
- Deploy the app to a free instance of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/pricing)


### Submission Instructions
- Break up the work into separate/logical commits.
- You can use as many branches as you need in order to organize your work, but you must make sure your completed code is on the `master` branch before bundling up your work.
- Your code should be clear and well-documented.
- When app is done, use `git bundle` to [bundle](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Bundling) up the repo <!--email it as an attachment and in that email, please remember to include the link to the Heroku site as well-->
